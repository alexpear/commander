TODO: 
-rapid fire, heavy etc rules
 -track moved, shot per unit

- simple assault, obv
 - assault function and/or command
 - ability for bots to assault
 - assault phase

-terrain
 -cover
 -difficult terrain
 -LoS

-bug: trying to move into occupied square does not print an error message. a subtle/silent crash?

-improve 'go' aka the method to make all rebels act()?
 -before each, print who is about to act
  -print as name or as sprite? both perhaps 

-structure as turns, end turn/phase action, etc 
 - track whether unit has used its movement/shooting so far this turn 
 - how much movement it has left
 - go / end turn required to refresh movement/shooting fields

-move some conceptual sections out into separate files/modules

-minigames:
 -at how uneven a points ratio can i win?

- enter more creatures' stats into data.py

- simple pathfinding for act()? even just random or searching only the adjacent spaces?


lower priority:
-printinfo command for a specific unit?     

-track how many casualities a unit has taken this turn/phase, for 25% morale check etc
 -other morale rules

-track original/starting strength of a unit, for morale / Scoring Units

-print notifications and shooting detail differently?
 -lowercase or indented shooting
 -preface major notifcations with ===, <<<, ppp, etc? 
 -in move(), dont draw map if error.

very low priority:
-could add ' aka prime notation, for 4 repeats of sprites




so what can i module out?
-Game vs Gamestate?
 -could Gamestate be its own module? 
-maybe a class for global methods?
 -some could go into class Game, some cant
 -Util
